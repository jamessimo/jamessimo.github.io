I"»<p>You may know already from visiting my site is that <strong>I live in China</strong>. I live in <strong><em>Suzhou, Jiangsu, China</em></strong> to be exact, which is about 100km west of Shanghai. I have lived in China for over 3 years now, I spent my first year in Suzhou teaching english and two years in Shanghai as a web developer. Now I have returned to Suzhou to be closer with my wife and work as a web+app UI designer.</p>

<p>Something I have wanted to do since I have arrived in China is to <strong>write about life in China</strong> and how I have adapted my day to day life. I <strong>love</strong> cooking, electronics &amp; Chinese culture and I want to write about it to help anyone who is thinking of coming to China as well as tips for people who are currently living here.</p>

<p>With that said, I will call this section of my blog <strong>‚ÄúCRASH COURSE CHINA‚Äù</strong> where I will write all the things I have learned in China, some topics I have drafted are;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Food and Cooking</strong></li>
  <li><strong>e-Bikes in China</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Law and Order</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Living with Chinese Internet</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Love and Marriage</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Buying &amp; Maintaining stuff in China</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to talk about things that I have learned by my self and stuff that no-one else online talks about, you wont find any of the common living in China stuff here. Think of these as <strong>‚ÄúLife Hacks‚Äù</strong> for China.</p>

<p>If you live near <strong>Suzhou</strong> and want to contact me feel free to add me on wechat or email me (<em>links in the bottom of the page</em>)

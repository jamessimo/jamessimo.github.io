You may know already from visiting my site is that **I live in China**. I live in ***Suzhou, Jiangsu, China*** to be exact, which is about 100km west of Shanghai. I have lived in China for over 3 years now, I spent my first year in Suzhou teaching english and two years in Shanghai as a web developer. Now I have returned to Suzhou to be closer with my wife and work as a web+app UI designer.

Something I have wanted to do since I have arrived in China is to **write about life in China** and how I have adapted my day to day life. I **love** cooking, electronics & Chinese culture and I want to write about it to help anyone who is thinking of coming to China as well as tips for people who are currently living here.

With that said, I will call this section of my blog **"CRASH COURSE CHINA"** where I will write all the things I have learned in China, some topics I have drafted are; 

* **Food and Cooking**
* **e-Bikes in China**
* **Law and Order**
* **Living with Chinese Internet**
* **Love and Marriage**
* **Buying & Maintaining stuff in China**
 
I want to talk about things that I have learned by my self and stuff that no-one else online talks about, you wont find any of the common living in China stuff here. Think of these as **"Life Hacks"** for China. 

If you live near **Suzhou** and want to contact me feel free to add me on wechat or email me (*links in the bottom of the page*)

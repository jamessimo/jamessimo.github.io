My first blog post has to acknolage how amazing using Jekyll is for my site. 

I dont only use Jekyll as a lightweight static blog, I have also ultilized its html pre-processing for my site.

**INCLUDES**

 now I include my header and footer using Liquid includes like so,
 
 {% highlight html %}
 <ul class="tag_list">
      {.% for tag in post.tags %}
      <li class="inline archive_list"><a class="tag_list_link" href="/tag/{.{ tag }}">{.{ tag }}</a></li>
      {.% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endhighlight %}
 
  which is really nice that now all the google analytics junk I put in my site can be edited once in oneplace the contact area have google events attached to them so on each page I had to write 72 lines of markup and javascript. 

**TAGS**

another cool think I have done with Jekyll is impliment a very basic tag system.

Jekyll gives the option to tag a post, or put a post in a catagory. I only wanted 4 catagorys however I am already ypset by the size of a given blog URL /2014/08/21/screen-sizes.html and if I used catagorys that would only add to the length of the url, so to keep it short I used tags, 

I followed http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/ however I didnt want to install any plugins so I opted just to copy this code 

 {% highlight html %}
<ul class="tag_list">
     {.% for tag in post.tags %}
     <li class="inline archive_list"><a class="tag_list_link" href="/tag/{.{ tag }}">{.{ tag }}</a></li>
     {.% endfor %}
   </ul>
{% endhighlight %}

and I made a page for each tag and only show posts for each tag, because I knew I only wanted people to sort through 4 topics I will cover. 

jamessimo.com/tags/html5 would have somthing like this 

{% highlight liquid %}
		{.% for post in site.tags.MYTAG %}
{% endhighlight %}
